\abstract{
In elections, a subset of candidates ranked consecutively (though possibly in~different order)
by all voters is called a clone set, and its members are called clones.
A clone structure is a family of all clone sets of a given election.
In~this work we study the problem of decloning, i.e. finding the clone structure of given cardinality.
We give a polynomial-time algorithm for decloning problem.
We also consider decloning into imperfect clone structure: we define error function measuring
cost of turning given clone sets family into clone structure.
Finally, we prove that optimal decloning for~sample error function is $NP$-complete.

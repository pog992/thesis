We are interested in a situation when some candidates are indistinguishable for voters.
In that case every voter ranks them consecutively.

\begin{defn}[clone set]
We say that non-empty $X \subseteq C$ is a clone set for preference profile $P = (\succ_1, ... , \succ_n)$ over $C$,
if for each $k,l \in X$, each $a \in C \backslash X$ and each $1 \leq i \leq n $ it holds that
$k \succ_i a$ iff $l \succ_i a$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[decloning]
We call a decloning for preference profile $P$ over $C$
such a partition of $C$  into $C_1, ... , C_k$
that for each $1 \leq i \leq k$ $C_i$ is a clone set for $P$.
\end{defn}


\begin{problem}{Decloning}
    Input: preference profile $P$, integer $k$

    Question: Is there a decloning for $P$ with cardinality $k$?
\end{problem}

$$
pos(i) =
    \begin{cases}
        \top & \text{if $i=0$ or } \exists X \in clones(i): p(i - \card{X}) \\
        \bot & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
$$

\begin{thm}
\textsc{Decloning} is in $P$.
\end{thm}
